To figure out what size is the best choice for having a large trapping frequency (possibly few hundreds of kHz) while keeping the scattering rate low (bellow $1\\text{ s}^{-1}$ or even $0.1\\text{ s}^{-1}$), it is useful to use color plots for those two quantities, while varying the beam waist $w_{0}$ and the detuning $\\Delta$, all at fixed laser power $P = 500\\text{ mW}$.
